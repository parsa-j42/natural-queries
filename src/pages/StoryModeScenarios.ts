- "Our sinks are developing reddish stains"

Your supervisor suspects high iron levels, which can cause:
- Staining and taste issues (> 0.3 mg/L)
- Infrastructure damage (> 1.0 mg/L)

Your supervisor has tasked you with a comprehensive investigation spanning the following areas:
1. Mapping the affected wells and identifying potentially vulnerable households
2. Analyzing well construction methods to spot any systematic issues
3. Correlating construction practices with water quality data

The results of your investigation will help guide new well construction standards and protect public health. Your database access gives you everything needed to uncover the source of these problems.`,

Our priorities for this phase:
- Create a comprehensive map of all wells in the affected townships
- Identify all well owners for potential notifications

- Do certain drilling companies consistently use different methods?
